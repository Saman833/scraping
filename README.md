# scraping
- in this code i have used BeutifulSoup library to scrap the webpage <br>
- you will see datas as json objects into the two json files generated by the main.py code <br>
- I have used dfs algortihm to find the tag we need to find for scraping the Proudcts part (two first parts  products and essentials) <br>
- I have also used some simple regex command to filter out the email part from the initial emails on the contact sections <br>
